# what is provider? 
==> In Terraform, a "provider" is a plugin that enables interaction with cloud providers, SaaS providers, and other APIs. Providers are responsible for defining and managing the lifecycle of resources within a given service. They handle API interactions, state management, and resource provisioning.

# What is Random Provider?
==> The Terraform Random provider is used to generate random values that can be used in your infrastructure configurations. It can create random strings, integers, passwords, pets, and other values. This is particularly useful for generating unique resource names, secrets, or any other value that requires a degree of randomness.
